# Automating The Improvement of Regex Patterns

Automating the improvement of regex patterns based on the similarity between all matched patterns for each variable within the regex pattern requires analyzing the effectiveness of each pattern dynamically and adjusting them based on the outcomes of their matches, potentially incorporating machine learning techniques for pattern recognition and optimization.

While directly incorporating such dynamic regex pattern improvement within the `ExtractNIKandPassportNumber` class goes beyond the scope of Python's regex capabilities and would significantly complicate the class structure,there is a conceptual approach to how one might start to think about automating the improvement of regex patterns:

- `Log Matching Details`: For each regex pattern, log the details of each match, including the matched text and its similarity score to the original text.

- `Analyze Effectiveness`: Analyze the logged data to determine the effectiveness of each regex pattern. Effectiveness can be measured by the accuracy of matches (e.g., how closely the matched text aligns with expected outcomes) and the similarity scores.

- `Pattern Adjustment`: Based on the analysis, adjust the regex patterns. This could involve refining existing patterns to increase precision or adding new patterns to cover missed cases. The adjustment process could initially be manual, based on the analysis, but over time, one might employ machine learning models trained on the logged data to suggest pattern modifications.

- `Iterative Improvement`: Continuously log match details, analyze pattern effectiveness, and adjust patterns. Over time, this iterative process should lead to more accurate and effective regex patterns.
